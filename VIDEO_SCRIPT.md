# 🎬 Curve DEX Limit Order Agent - Hackathon Demo Script

## 📋 **Demo Overview (5-7 minutes)**

**What to say:** "Hi everyone! I'm [Your Name] and today I'm presenting my Curve DEX Limit Order Agent for the hackathon. This is a C++ implementation that creates and manages limit orders on Curve DEX with support for multiple Time-in-Force policies, real-time price monitoring, slippage protection, and advanced features like IOC partial fills and FOK liquidity verification."

---

## 🎯 **Part 1: Project Overview & Architecture (45 seconds)**

**What to say:** "The system supports four Time-in-Force policies: GTC (Good-Till-Canceled), GTT (Good-Till-Time), IOC (Immediate-Or-Cancel), and FOK (Fill-Or-Kill). It includes real-time price monitoring, slippage protection, and advanced features like partial fills for IOC orders and liquidity verification for FOK orders."

**Show code:** Open `include/limit_order.h` and highlight:
```cpp
enum class TimeInForce {
    GTC,  // Good-Till-Canceled
    GTT,  // Good-Till-Time
    IOC,  // Immediate-Or-Cancel
    FOK   // Fill-Or-Kill
};
```

**What to say:** "The system is built with a modular architecture that separates price monitoring, order management, and execution logic. Each TIF policy has its own execution engine with specialized behavior."

---

## 🚀 **Part 2: Setup & Configuration (1 minute)**

**What to say:** "Let me show you how easy it is to set up. The system includes an automated wallet setup script that configures everything for Sepolia testnet with proper security measures."

**Show code:** Run the setup script:
```bash
./setup_wallet.sh
```

**What to say:** "The script guides you through creating a wallet, getting RPC credentials, and automatically updates the configuration. Notice how it validates the private key format and provides security warnings. I'm using Alchemy as my RPC provider for reliable Sepolia testnet access."

**Show code:** Open `include/sepolia_config.h` and highlight:
```cpp
// Network Configuration
const std::string SEPOLIA_RPC_URL = "https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/...";
const uint64_t SEPOLIA_CHAIN_ID = 11155111;

// Wallet Configuration  
const std::string PRIVATE_KEY = "0x...";
const std::string ADDRESS = "0x...";
```

**What to say:** "For security, I created a dedicated MetaMask wallet specifically for this hackathon. Never use your main wallet for testing! The wallet address I'm using is 0x00Da5B17c4b3A17f787491868A6200A4bFe01DE8."

---

## ⚡ **Part 3: Core Features Demo (2 minutes)**

**What to say:** "Now let's see the system in action. I'll demonstrate each Time-in-Force policy with real examples."

### **GTC (Good-Till-Canceled) - Default Behavior**
**What to say:** "GTC orders run continuously until the price target is met. Watch how it monitors prices and executes when conditions are right."

**Show code:** Run:
```bash
make main
# GTC order with LOW limit price - will execute when price target met
USE_MOCK_PRICING=1 ./build/curve_dex_limit_order_agent 0xPool 1 0 1000000 GTC 0.5
```

**What to say:** "See how it checks prices, calculates slippage protection, and executes the swap when the target is reached. The system automatically handles price monitoring and execution."

### **IOC (Immediate-Or-Cancel) - Partial Fill Support**
**What to say:** "IOC orders execute immediately or cancel. My implementation includes advanced partial fill support - if the full order can't be filled, it fills what's available and cancels the rest. For this demo, I'll use mock pricing to show the cancellation scenario clearly."

**Show code:** Run:
```bash
# IOC order with HIGH limit price - will cancel immediately
USE_MOCK_PRICING=1 ./build/curve_dex_limit_order_agent 0xPool 1 0 1000000 IOC 2.0
```

**Show code:** Open `src/curve_dex_limit_order_agent.cpp` and highlight:
```cpp
// IOC Partial Fill Logic
void executeIOC(LimitOrder &order)
{
    uint64_t current_output = pool.get_dy(order.input_token_index, 
                                         order.output_token_index, 
                                         order.input_amount);
    order.recordPriceCheck(current_output);

    if (order.isPriceMet(current_output)) {
        // Full fill possible
        executeSwap(order, order.input_amount);
    } else {
        // Partial fill logic
        uint64_t max_fillable = order.getMaxFillableAmount(current_output);
        if (max_fillable > 0) {
            executeSwap(order, max_fillable);
            order.updateStatus(OrderStatus::PARTIALLY_FILLED, "Partial fill executed");
        } else {
            order.updateStatus(OrderStatus::CANCELED, "Price not met for any execution");
        }
    }
}
```

**What to say:** "This IOC implementation is sophisticated - it calculates the maximum fillable amount at the current price and executes partial fills when possible. This is crucial for volatile markets where you want to capture any profitable opportunities."

### **FOK (Fill-Or-Kill) - Liquidity Verification**
**What to say:** "FOK orders require the entire order to be filled or they cancel. I've added optional liquidity verification to ensure the pool can handle the full order size before attempting execution."

**Show code:** Run:
```bash
./build/curve_dex_limit_order_agent 0xPool 1 0 1000000 FOK
```

**Show code:** Open `src/curve_dex_limit_order_agent.cpp` and highlight:
```cpp
// FOK Liquidity Check
void executeFOK(LimitOrder &order)
{
    uint64_t current_output = pool.get_dy(order.input_token_index, 
                                         order.output_token_index, 
                                         order.input_amount);
    order.recordPriceCheck(current_output);

    if (order.isPriceMet(current_output)) {
        // Verify liquidity can handle full order
        uint64_t larger_quote = pool.get_dy(order.input_token_index, 
                                           order.output_token_index, 
                                           order.input_amount * 101 / 100);
        if (larger_quote == 0) {
            order.updateStatus(OrderStatus::CANCELED, "Insufficient liquidity for FOK order");
            return;
        }
        
        // Execute full order
        executeSwap(order, order.input_amount);
    } else {
        order.updateStatus(OrderStatus::CANCELED, "FOK: Price not met, order killed");
    }
}
```

**What to say:** "The FOK implementation includes a liquidity check that tests if the pool can handle slightly larger orders. This prevents failed transactions and ensures the order only executes when there's sufficient liquidity."

### **Order Cancellation Demonstration**
**What to say:** "Let me show you how the system handles order cancellation. I'll create orders with different scenarios to demonstrate the cancellation logic in action."

**Show code:** Run these commands to demonstrate different cancellation scenarios:

```bash
# 1. IOC Order with HIGH limit price - Will Cancel Immediately
USE_MOCK_PRICING=1 ./build/curve_dex_limit_order_agent 0xPool 1 0 1000000 IOC 2.0

# 2. FOK Order with Insufficient Liquidity - Will Cancel Due to Liquidity Check
SKIP_LIQUIDITY_CHECK=0 ./build/curve_dex_limit_order_agent 0xPool 1 0 1000000000 FOK

# 3. GTT Order with Short Expiry - Will Cancel After Time Expires
./build/curve_dex_limit_order_agent 0xPool 1 0 1000000 GTT 1

# 4. GTC Order with Demo Limit - Will Cancel After Max Checks
./build/curve_dex_limit_order_agent 0xPool 1 0 1000000 GTC
```

**Alternative: Use the automated test script:**
```bash
# Run all cancellation scenarios automatically
./test_cancellation.sh
```

**What to say:** "Notice how each TIF policy handles cancellation differently. IOC orders cancel immediately if the price isn't met, FOK orders cancel if there's insufficient liquidity, GTT orders expire naturally, and GTC orders can be manually stopped or reach demo limits."

**Show code:** Open `src/curve_dex_limit_order_agent.cpp` and highlight the cancellation logic:
```cpp
// GTC Demo Limit Cancellation
if (check_count >= max_checks) {
    order.updateStatus(OrderStatus::CANCELED, "Demo limit reached");
    std::cout << "⏰ GTC Order stopped after " << max_checks << " price checks (demo mode)" << std::endl;
}

// GTT Expiry Cancellation
if (order.isExpired()) {
    order.updateStatus(OrderStatus::EXPIRED, "Order expired");
    std::cout << "⏰ GTT Order EXPIRED without execution" << std::endl;
}

// IOC Price-Based Cancellation
if (max_fillable == 0) {
    order.updateStatus(OrderStatus::CANCELED, "Price not met for any execution");
    std::cout << "❌ IOC Order CANCELED - price not met" << std::endl;
}

// FOK Liquidity Cancellation
if (test_output == 0) {
    order.updateStatus(OrderStatus::CANCELED, "FOK: Insufficient liquidity for full order");
    std::cout << "💀 FOK Order KILLED - insufficient liquidity" << std::endl;
    return;
}
```

**What to say:** "The cancellation system is comprehensive and handles all failure modes gracefully. Each TIF policy has specific cancellation criteria that ensure orders don't hang indefinitely and provide clear feedback on why they were canceled."

---

## 📊 **Part 4: Price Monitoring & Testing (1 minute)**

**What to say:** "The system includes comprehensive price monitoring and testing. Let me show you the price monitor and test suite."

**Show code:** Run:
```bash
make price_monitor
```

**What to say:** "This shows real-time price monitoring with statistics and volatility tracking. The system connects to Sepolia testnet and queries actual Curve pools for live pricing data."

**Show code:** Run:
```bash
make test_all
```

**What to say:** "The test suite covers all TIF policies, partial fills, slippage protection, and end-to-end scenarios. All 39 unit tests and 13 E2E tests pass, including the new IOC partial fill and FOK liquidity verification tests."

**Show code:** Open `tests/e2e_tests.cpp` and highlight:
```cpp
// IOC Partial Fill Test
void test_ioc_order_immediate_execution()
{
    // Test IOC order with partial fill support
    auto ioc_order = OrderFactory::createIOC(
        "E2E_IOC", "0xTokenA", "0xTokenB", 500000, 1.05, 0.005, "0xUser", "test_key");
    
    // Test partial fill logic
    uint64_t max_fillable = ioc_order->getMaxFillableAmount(current_output);
    if (max_fillable > 0) {
        // Execute partial fill
        executeSwap(*ioc_order, max_fillable);
        ioc_order->updateStatus(OrderStatus::PARTIALLY_FILLED, "Partial fill executed");
    }
}
```

---

## 🔧 **Part 5: Technical Highlights (1 minute)**

**What to say:** "Let me highlight some key technical features that make this system robust and production-ready."

**Show code:** Open `include/limit_order.h` and highlight:
```cpp
// Advanced Slippage Protection
uint64_t getMinOutputWithSlippage(uint64_t current_market_output) const {
    return static_cast<uint64_t>(current_market_output * (1.0 - slippage_tolerance));
}

// Sophisticated Partial Fill Support
uint64_t getMaxFillableAmount(uint64_t current_output) const {
    if (input_amount == 0) return 0;
    
    uint64_t remaining_amount = input_amount - filled_amount;
    if (remaining_amount == 0) return 0;
        
    // If current rate meets limit, we can fill the remaining amount
    if (isPriceMet(current_output)) return remaining_amount;
        
    return 0;
}

// Price Validation with Multiple Checks
bool isPriceMet(uint64_t current_output) const {
    if (input_amount == 0) return false;
    double current_rate = static_cast<double>(current_output) / static_cast<double>(input_amount);
    return current_rate >= limit_price;
}
```

**What to say:** "The system includes sophisticated slippage protection, partial fill calculations, and price validation logic. The partial fill system is particularly advanced - it calculates exactly how much of an order can be filled at the current market price while respecting the limit price and slippage tolerance. For the demo, I use mock pricing to clearly demonstrate both execution and cancellation scenarios."

**Show code:** Open `src/curve_dex_limit_order_agent.cpp` and highlight:
```cpp
// Real-time Price Monitoring Loop
while (order.isExecutable() && check_count < max_checks) {
    try {
        uint64_t current_output = pool.get_dy(order.input_token_index, 
                                             order.output_token_index, 
                                             order.input_amount);
        order.recordPriceCheck(current_output);

        if (order.isPriceMet(current_output)) {
            uint64_t min_output = order.getMinOutputWithSlippage(current_output);
            std::string tx_hash = pool.executeSwap(order.input_token_index, 
                                                 order.output_token_index,
                                                 order.input_amount, min_output);
            
            order.transaction_hash = tx_hash;
            order.filled_amount = order.input_amount;
            order.updateStatus(OrderStatus::FILLED);
            return;
        }
        
        check_count++;
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
    } catch (const std::exception &e) {
        std::cerr << "Error in execution: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
}
```

**What to say:** "The price monitoring system includes error handling, retry logic, and configurable polling intervals. It's designed to be robust in production environments with real network conditions."
